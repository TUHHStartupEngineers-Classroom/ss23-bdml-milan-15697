    "text": "Your organization wants to know which companies are similar to each other to help in identifying potential customers of a SAAS software solution (e.g. Salesforce CRM or equivalent) in various segments of the market. The Sales Department is very interested in this analysis, which will help them more easily penetrate various market segments.\nYou will be using stock prices in this analysis. You come up with a method to classify companies based on how their stocks trade using their daily stock returns (percentage movement from one day to the next). This analysis will help your organization determine which companies are related to each other (competitors and have similar attributes).\nYou can analyze the stock prices using what you’ve learned in the unsupervised learning tools including K-Means and UMAP. You will use a combination of kmeans() to find groups and umap() to visualize similarity of daily stock returns."

The challenge here is to connect the dots between what we have and what we need to do to format it properly.\nWe know that in order to compare the data, it needs to be standardized or normalized. Why? Because we cannot compare values (stock prices) that are of completely different magnitudes. In order to standardize, we will convert from adjusted stock price (dollar value) to daily returns (percent change from previous day). Here is the formula.\n\\[\nreturn_{daily} = \\frac{price_{i}-price_{i-1}}{price_{i-1}}\n\\]\nFirst, what do we have?

The Sales Department is very interested in this analysis, which will help them more easily penetrate various market segments.\nYou will be using stock prices in this analysis. You come up with a method to classify companies based on how their stocks trade using their daily stock returns (percentage movement from one day to the next). This analysis will help your organization determine which companies are related to each other (competitors and have similar attributes).\nYou can analyze the stock prices using what you’ve learned in the unsupervised learning tools including K-Means and UMAP. You will use a combination of kmeans() to find groups and umap() to visualize similarity of daily stock returns."

    "text": "Step 1 - Convert stock prices to a standardized format (daily returns)\nWhat you first need to do is get the data in a format that can be converted to a “user-item” style matrix. The challenge here is to connect the dots between what we have and what we need to do to format it properly.\nWe know that in order to compare the data, it needs to be standardized or normalized. Why? Because we cannot compare values (stock prices) that are of completely different magnitudes. In order to standardize, we will convert from adjusted stock price (dollar value) to daily returns (percent change from previous day). Here is the formula.\n\\[\nreturn_{daily} = \\frac{price_{i}-price_{i-1}}{price_{i-1}}\n\\]\nFirst, what do we have? We have stock prices for every stock in the SP 500 Index, which is the daily stock prices for over 500 stocks.
